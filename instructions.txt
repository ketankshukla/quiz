Create a quiz web app for me 50 python related multiple choice questions. 4 choices per question. Create a beautiful web app with nice pythonic colours. Deploy for vercel. Create multiple separate artifacts per module. Do not jam all the code in a single artifact. Create separate artifacts for html, css, JavaScript and python code. All logic goes in python code. Use JavaScript for web interactions only. Create a serverless app. I want 50 python related questions. Store the questions in a json file. Refactor the code professionally. Separate data from business logic. Use best pythonic and coding practices. Structure the app to be deployed to vercel. Create a users guide.
